# git trim

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/git/trim`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'git-trim'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install git-trim

## Usage

You can call `git trim` and it will remove any branch that isn't currently merged into the current branch that isn't also in the `.git-protected-branches` file. It will not remove the main branch.

The `.git-protected-branches` file can reside in the current directory or any parent directory. Branch names are each listed on a line in the file. For example:

```
main
staging
production
```
